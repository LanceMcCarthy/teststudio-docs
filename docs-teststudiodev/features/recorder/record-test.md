Double click a web test from the Solution Explorer to open it. Click on any of the _Record_ buttons to start the recording process.

In the dialog that pops up enter the URL to record a test against and select the recording browser. Then click on __Record__ button.

The URLs recently used for recording will be listed in the _Recent URLs_ section where you can select directly any of them.

The recording browser will start and navigate to the selected URL. Once the URL is fully loaded the <a href="/features/recorder/recording-toolbar" target="_blank">Test Studio Dev Recorder Toolbar</a> gets attached to the browser and you can start performing the desired scenario. Each action against the page is automatically recorded and presented by a single step in the test.

* __Current Path Expanded__ - the field is read-only and display the full path to application if environment variables are used.
* __Use default path__ - whether to use the path set here or the default path set in Project Settings > Others __(add link to the article)__.
* __Active WPF Applications__ - Progress Test Studio detects all WPF apps currently running and lists them. Highlight the desired app and press Select Application.
* __Recording Options__ - whether to record window state changes.

Click on _OK_ button to confirm the configuration.

Once you have configured the test click on any of the _Record_ buttons to launch a new instance of the application to record against.

The <a href="/features/recorder/recording-toolbar" target="_blank">Test Studio Dev Recorder Toolbar</a> gets attached to the application instance and you can start performing the desired scenario. Each action against the application is automatically recorded and presented by a single step in the test.

To stop the recording session close the WPF application.
