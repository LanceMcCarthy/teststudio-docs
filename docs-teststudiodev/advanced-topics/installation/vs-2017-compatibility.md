# Visual Studio 2017 Installation to Be Compatible with Test Studio Dev Edition

**Test Studio Dev Edition** is compatible with the latest **Visual Studio 2017** after an individual component is added to the Visual Studio installation.

To ensure that Test Studio plug-in will be visible and working in Visual Studio 2017 you need to modify its installation and include the **Testing Tools Core Features** component under Debugging and Testing section.
