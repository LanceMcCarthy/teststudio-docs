# Dialog Handler Updater

Browsers are constantly evolving. They come with a couple of official releases per year and few more updates. Some of these updates are changing the UI structure of the whole browser. This, on other hand, is impacting how Test Studio handles the dialog and notification windows.

Hence, after such breaking changes introduced by the browsers, Test Studio should be updated accordingly. This is managed with the __Dialog handler update__ functionality. If you are using the latest official release of Test Studio, and there is a browser update which somehow is affecting the tool normal operation, a notification for __Dialog handler update__ will  be shown next to the _Calibrate browsers_ button.

![Handler Update Notification][1]

For an immediate update of the Dialog handler click button _Calibrate browsers_. The <a href="/features/project-settings/overview" target="_blank">_Project Settings_</a> window will popup pointing to its _Browsers_ section. Click _Update_ button next to ___Dialog Handler update available___ notification.

Once the update is successfully installed you need to restart Test Studio in order the changes to take effect.
