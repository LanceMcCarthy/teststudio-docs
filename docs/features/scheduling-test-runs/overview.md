# Scheduling Test Runs, Optionally Remotely (Standalone only)

Test Studio Scheduling allows you to select a <a href="/getting-started/test-execution/test-lists-standalone" target="_blank">test list</a> to execute at a future time, set the date and time for the test run and return later to see the results. The Scheduling Service could be also used to schedule a test list to run on remote machines.

From your local instance of Test Studio test lists could be scheduled on any machine in the network including virtual machines. If you have to run a number of tests, you can spread the workload between different machines in order to reduce the total execution time. All the results will be stored in one centralized location for you to examine later.

Depending on the scheduling scenario setup will vary. There are two main scenarios: 

- &nbsp; <a href="/features/scheduling-test-runs/local-run-all-in-one" target="_blank">**All-in-one installation for local execution**</a> (create, schedule and execute tests all on one machine) to schedule and run test lists on the local machine

- &nbsp; <a href="/features/scheduling-test-runs/remote-run-all-in-one" target="_blank">**Remote execution installation**</a>, where the Test Studio Standalone installation, Scheduling Server and Execution client could be **optionally** on more than one machine

## Differences between both setups

Below is a diagram of the Scheduling setup and how its components communicate between each other:

### Local setup

The local all-in-one setup allows you to <a href="/features/scheduling-test-runs/local-run-all-in-one" target="_blank">schedule the test lists</a> for a certain time in the future. The execution is on the same machine and complete standalone installation of Test Studio is sufficient to setup that configuration. 

In addition to the local scheduling feature the local all-in-one installation could be used to<a href="/features/scheduling-test-runs/remote-run-all-in-one" target="_blank">simulate remote run</a> on the same machine.

### Remote Setup

The remote configuration allows you to execute and/or schedule test lists on multiple machines <a href="/knowledge-base/test-execution-kb/multi-browsers#How-to-Run-Tests-in-Parallel" target="_blank">even simultaneously</a>. 

The setup may vary from single to multiple execution machines. It only requires <a href="/features/scheduling-test-runs/create-scheduling-server" target="_blank">scheduler</a> and <a href="/features/scheduling-test-runs/create-storage-server" target="_blank">storage</a> to be configured once on any of the machines and <a href="/features/scheduling-test-runs/create-execution-server" target="_blank">all execution clients need to be connected to that single scheduler</a>.
