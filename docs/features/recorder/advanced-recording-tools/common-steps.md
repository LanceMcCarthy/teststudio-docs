# Common Steps Tab

Test Studio tests are equipped with various useful actions, which are not directly related to the elements in the application under test - e.g. refresh the browser, maximize the browser/application window, insert an execution delay, add a comment between two steps, etc. The **Advanced Recording Tools** window allows you to easily access these common steps without the need to switch to Test Studio <a href="/features/custom-steps/overview" target="_blank">Step Builder</a>.

At any point, during an active recording session, you can switch to the __Common Steps__ tab and select the necessary step from the list. Use the **Add Step** button to add it into the sequence of steps in the test.

> You can add these steps also without recording session through the <a href="/features/custom-steps/overview" target="_blank">Step Builder</a>.
