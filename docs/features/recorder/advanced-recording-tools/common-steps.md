# Common Steps

You can add common steps to your active test, while you are still recording your test scenario. This allows you to configure your test during an active recording session and ensure that you will have a stable test to execute. It is easier to add any additional common steps, like execution delay or actions against the browser, during the recording process.

At any point, during an active recording session, you can select the necessary step from the list and click **Add Step** to add it. You can configure the newly added steps in the <a href="/features/test-maintenance/test-step-properties" target="_blank">Step Properties</a> pane in Test Studio now or when you finish all steps for the test scenario.
