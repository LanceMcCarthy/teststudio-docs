# Element Options in Recording Mode

The __Highlighting menu__ is a powerful set of options related to the targeted element. It brings additional options to interact with an element in the terms of test recording, apart from clicking or entering text.

In this article you will find useful details and hints about the highlighting feature in Test Studio recorder and how to get most benefits of this.

## Add to Elements

**Add to Elements** option allows you to add the highlighted element to the selected test in project as an _'external reference'_ - that means the element is not related to any step from the test, but is still listed in it and can be referred from a coded step, for example.

## Locate in DOM

**Locate in DOM** is an option, which directly opens the <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/dom-explorer" target="_blank">DOM Explorer in the __Advanced Recording Tools__</a> and selects the highlighted element in the DOM structure of the page. You can further explore the surrounding elements of the selected one, or use the options for building a step using this element.

## Build Step

**Build Step...** is an option very similar to the __Locate In DOM__ one - it selects the highlighted element in the DOM tree and directly switches to the <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/steps-overview" target="_blank">Element Steps</a> tab in the __Advanced Recording Tools__.

![Build Step][7]

There are additional actions and verifications you can add against the selected element. For example, you can add mouse actions and <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/advanced-verification" target="_blank">advanced verification steps</a> for attribute, image or text from image.
