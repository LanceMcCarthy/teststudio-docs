description: "Verifications in Test Studio. Measure and record if an occurrence happened or did not happen as expected during a test run in Test Studio. Verifications in Test Studio can measure against multiple criteria at one time, can build measurements in an interactive manner without code, can detect if elements are in a particular state (e.g. is visible, exists), can detect if attributes and properties compare with specific values, can verify content, attributes, styles, visibility, drop-down list selections, checkboxes, radio buttons, tables and Silverlight property values"

# Verifications

Automation is only the starting point of testing where the browser is manipulated automatically without tester intervention. Once you've automated the interaction, you still have to test something, such as measuring and recording that an occurrence happened or did not happen as expected. There are several ways to verify elements in Test Studio:

- <a href="/features/recorder/verifications/quick-verification" target="_blank">Quick Verification</a> - create an easy verification from the Quick Tasks menu.

- <a href="/features/recorder/verifications/advanced-verification" target="_blank">Advanced Verification</a> - craft a custom verification from the Sentence Verification Builder.

- <a href="/features/recorder/verifications/wait" target="_blank">Wait</a> - does not continue until the comparison is true.

- <a href="/features/recorder/verifications/extraction" target="_blank">Extraction</a> - extract an element's value and reuse it later in your test.

- <a href="/features/recorder/verifications/image-verification" target="_blank">Image Verification</a> - this feature is based on an elementâ€™s visual rendering rather than the properties or attributes of that element.

Verifications in Test Studio allow you to:

- Measure against multiple criteria at one time.
- Build these measurements in an interactive manner without code.
- Detect if elements are in a particular state (e.g. is visible, exists).
- Detect if attributes and properties compare with specific values.
- Verify content, attributes, styles, visibility, drop-down list selections, checkboxes, radio buttons, tables and Silverlight property values.

Test Studio implements verification through "sentences" that compare a portion of an element to a value, such as:

- textbox content is equal to 'order 2011'
- image path contains 'http://www.telerik.com'
- wait for element to exist

> Test Studio cannot read and verify against the contents of a PDF file loaded in the browser, as it does not have a DOM structure like a traditional web page. If you can store that information in a file type such as XLS, XML, CSV, or a SQL database, then you can use the <a href="/features/data-driven-testing/Overview" target="blank">Data Driving</a> feature.
