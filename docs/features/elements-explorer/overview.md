# Elements Explorer #

The Elements Explorer is similar to the DOM Explorer in that it displays a tree of elements, but the Elements Explorer only contains elements you want to use in your tests. Also, the elements in the tree view have properties that are more specific to testing. Although elements may be used in several tests and test steps, each element is shown only once in the Elements Explorer.

You can find the Elements Explorer under/next to the Project's Explorer on the left bottom pane.

![Standalone Version][1]

**Standalone Version**

![VS Plugin][2]

**VS Plugin**

The Elements tab, maintains a list of all Elements within the current project. It provides a one-stop shop to view elements and edit the way they are found during execution.

## Element's Explorer Menu Bar ##

The Elements menu bar ![Elements bar][3] has the following buttons:

- **Add Element** - add a <a href="/features/elements-explorer/predefined-elements" target="_blank">Predefined element</a>.
- **Element Mapping (IntelliMap)** - <a href="/features/elements-explorer/element-mapping" target="_blank">Map</a> a Predefined element.
- **Search** - search the Explorer based on the element Friendly Name property.
- **Sort** - organize the elements in an ascending or descending order, or clear the sorting.
- **Refresh** - refresh the display of elements in the Explorer. You seldom should have to do this because Test Studio  normally refreshes the window properly.
- **Enable/Disable Highlighting** - control the highlighting of elements on the recording surface as they are selected in the tree view. When enabled, an element highlighted in the Elements pane will also be highlighted in the active browser.
- **Expand/Collapse** - show or hide all elements under their respective page nodes.
- **This Test/All Tests** - show elements for the currently loaded test only, or the elements for every test in the project.

## Hierarchy of Recorded Elements ##

<table id="no-table">
<tr>
<td>![HTML Tree View][4]<br>**HTML Tree View**</td>
<td>![Silverlight Tree View][5]<br>**Silverlight Tree View**</td>
<td>![WPF Tree View][6]<br> **WPF Tree View**</td>
</tr>
<table>

- The HTML tree view is organized by **Page > Frame > Test Regions > Element**.
- The Silverlight tree view is organized by **Page > Frame > SilverlightApp > Element**.
- The WPF tree view is organized by **Application > Window > Element**.

The hierarchy is maintained according to where the element is located on the page. For example, if there are no frames or regions, then elements for that particular page will be listed under the Page node.
