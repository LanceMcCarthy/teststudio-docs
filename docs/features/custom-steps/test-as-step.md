# Test as Step

This feature allows you to run an existing test as a single step within another test. This can help to reuse common automated test steps in the project. This is also known as test modularization. The approach includes breaking up your testing tasks into modules that do specific small functions on their own, but do not perform the complete end-to-end testing scenario.

Here is a sample project for Amazon.com:

Here is a sample Login test:


![Login Test](/img/features/custom-steps/test-as-step/fig2.png)

Once the test modules are in place, they could be added to high-level tests with the **Test as Step** function. Open *AddToCart* test and add the Login test to its beginning.


<table>
<tr>
<th> ![Test as Step](/img/features/custom-steps/test-as-step/fig3.png) <br><br> Step Builder is available in both Standalone Version and VS Plugin</th>
</tr>
<table>

Choose the Login test and click **Select**.

The Login test will be inserted into the AddToCart test as a single step. The steps of the Login test will be executed before moving on to step 3 in this example.
