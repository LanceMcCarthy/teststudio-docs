# Check for JavaScript Errors

Insert a step to verify if there are any JS errors generated on the current page.

> The page in the current example does not actually contain JavaScript errors. These were generated on purpose to demonstrate the feature.

## Add Step to Check for JS Errors

If not modified the default added step will check for any JS errors and will pass if there are none. If some errors are detected the step will fail and list the errors and their count per error text in the step failure details.

The execution log file also contains the failure information.

## Exclude JS Errors 

You can specify, though, which errors to be excluded from that count. The text of all errors to be excluded can be listed in the __ExcludedErrors__ property of the step. This field can be also data driven.

The check is if the error text contains the text listed in the __ExcludedErrors__ field. The result after execution specifies there are no errors containing the populated error text.

Multiple errors can be excluded as well - separate the errors text with '|'. Be aware that single space charachter is also taken into account and could cause false positive results.

The log of the test execution provides details which are the excluded errors and if there are any other.
