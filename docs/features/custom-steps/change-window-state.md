# Change Window State

This feature is WPF-specific and is only available in a WPF Test. **Capture Window** is also available - it is used just like <a href="/features/custom-steps/capture" target="_blank">Capture Browser</a>.

As of version 2015 R1 you can find the custom steps in the <a href="/getting-started/test-recording/step-suggestions" target="_blank">Step Builder</a> under General section.

![Step Builder][3]

Be sure to enter the applicable WindowCaption so Test Studio acts on the correct window. The WindowState options are:

- Normal
- Minimized
- Maximized
- Closed
