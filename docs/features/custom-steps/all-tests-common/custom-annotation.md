# Custom Annotation

The __Custom Annotation__ step allows you to insert some text that displays in the browser during a Quick Execution run. You can use this to communicate with the test reviewer, or if you want to point out some information to the developer.

This article demonstrates how to add this type of step into the test.

Choose the __Custom Annotation__ option from the <a href="/features/custom-steps/overview" target="_blank">__Step Builder__</a> and click on the __Add Step__ button in the lower right corner of the pane.

> __Custom Annotation__ step displays the inserted text only when <a href="/automated-tests/test-execution/quick-run-annotations" target="_blank">running the test with enabled annotations</a>.

Other useful properties of the step are:

- **DisplayLocation** - choose where the annotation displays relative to the browser/app window.
- **DisplayTime** - the amount of time (in milliseconds) for which the annotation is on screen.
