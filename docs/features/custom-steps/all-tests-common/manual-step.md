# Manual Step

The __Manual Step__ displays directions for performing manual actions at a specific point in the test. It can be useful for any specific action which cannot be automated, but can easily handled manually - e.g. handling he Captcha images.

This article demonstrates how to add this type of step into the test.

Choose the __Manual Step__ option from the <a href="/features/custom-steps/overview" target="_blank">__Step Builder__</a> and click on the __Add Step__ button in the lower right corner of the pane.

Insert description for the manual steps to be performed and set the timeout for execution of that step. The _ExecutionTimeout_ property is set __in minutes__ and sets the time to wait for the manual execution. If the _Manual Step_ is not handled within the timeout, it times out and logs as failure.

A perfect use for the __Manual Step__ is for accessing pages which use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA" target="_blank">CAPTCHA</a> code. Test Studio cannot automate the CAPTCHA type of images because their content cannot be read. In fact, CAPTCHA is specifically designed to ensure the response is generated by a person, and not a computer or an automation tool.

When dealing with this sort of validation we recommend to disable it for the testing environment and use the __Manual Step__ for production testing to the tester to handle the image.
