# API Test as Step

Test Studio supports the execution of API calls managed in an API test from the context of other test types.

This article demonstrates how to add the API test as step.

## Insert API Test as a Step

Choose the _API Test as Step_ option from the <a href="/features/custom-steps/overview" target="_blank">__Step Builder__</a> and click on the __Add Step__ button in the lower right corner of the pane.

The available options to add an API test are either to <a href="/automated-tests/execute-apitest/add-api-test-as-step#create-test" target="_blank">create a new test</a> or <a href="/automated-tests/execute-apitest/add-api-test-as-step#import-existing-test" target="_blank">import an existing</a> one. If you choose to add a test from existing project, you need to <a href="/automated-tests/execute-apitest/edit-integrated-api-project" target="_blank">manually re-add all external dependencies</a>.
