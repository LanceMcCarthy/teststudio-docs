# Comment Step

The __Comment__ step allows you to insert a comment in between the action steps. Use this step to make notes throughout your test and provide more information to those reading the test results.

This article demonstrates how to add this type of step into the test.

Choose the __Comment__ option from the <a href="/features/custom-steps/overview" target="_blank">__Step Builder__</a> and click on the __Add Step__ button in the lower right corner of the pane.
