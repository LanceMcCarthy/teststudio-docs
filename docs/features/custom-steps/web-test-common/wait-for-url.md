# Wait for URL

The __Wait for URL__ feature allows you to pause the test until the specified URL is loaded into the browser address bar. It is useful when the page redirects through few URLs and you need to wait for the final URL to be loaded.

This article demonstrates how to add this type of step into the test.

Choose the __Wait for URL__ option from the <a href="/features/custom-steps/overview" target="_blank">__Step Builder__</a> and click on the __Add Step__ button in the lower right corner of the pane.
