	* __WPF Application Path__ - drag and drop the shortcut icon into this text box, or click __Browse__ and locate it manually.
	* __Current Path Expanded__ - read-only display of full path if environment variables are used.
	* __Use default path__ - whether to use the path set here or the default path set in __Project Settings > General__.
	* __Active WPF Applications__ - Progress Test Studio detects all WPF apps currently running and lists them. Highlight the desired app and press __Select Application__.
	* __Recording Options__ - set the default behavior whether to record window state changes.
