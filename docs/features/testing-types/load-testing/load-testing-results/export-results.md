# Export Load Testing Results

Test Studio allows you to export the generated load test results to either HTML file or an Excel spreadsheet. 

## Select a Test Run Result to Export

Under the <a href="/features/testing-types/load-testing/analyzing-results" target="_blank">**Analyze**</a> view in the load test pane are listed all executed test runs. Each of these can be exported using the **Export** button on the Overall results view. Each of the test run results can be exported one by one.

## Choose the File Format to Export to

In the download dialog to appear, you can browse the location to store the exported results file, change the name of the file - by default Test Studio uses the <a href="/features/testing-types/load-testing/running-load-test/running-tests#test-run-description" target="_blank">**Test Run Description**</a> for the selected run. The other option to choose is the type of exported file - the **Save as type** dropdown allows you to choose between **HTML or Excel** file.
