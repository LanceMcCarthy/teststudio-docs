# Analyzing Results

During your test runs you’ll be shown clear, informative screens letting you know the state of your system throughout the run. You’re able to focus in on exactly the metrics you’re interested in, such as total errors, traffic size, time to first byte, and other common metrics.

This screen shows you the aggregated data collected from all of the load agents stored in the Results Database that are associated with the load controller you are currently connected to.

![Analyze Results][1]

For each result, click ![Details Icon][2] for test details or click ![Analysis Icon][3] to analyze results.

![Icons][4]

 Choose one of the results listed on the left to see the detailed data for that result set. Each result has a colored vertical bar to the left: green indicates success, red failure.

![Details][5]

The details screen shows up-to-date information about the current state of the selected test, separated into the Dashboard, Goals, and Page Specific Metrics.

The Dashboard page displays a graph of the progress of test goals.

![Dashboard][6]

The Goals page displays a summary of which goals passed or failed, and why.

![Goals][7]

The Page Specific Metrics screen displays information for specific pages. This includes the full URL, the total HTTP errors for that URL, and the goal results for that URL.

![Page Specific Metrics][8]

Click a specific URL to see error details.

![URL Details][9]

The analysis screen lets the user compare up to 5 metrics from different runs at the same time.

![Analysis Screen][10]

Choose to analyze data from the Overall Test and/or individual agents:

![Agents][11]

Statistics for each selected metric appear at the top of the analysis screen.
A graph of the selected metrics appears below the statistics.

![Statistics][12]

Drag the vertical bar to view the metric values for a specific time.

	<td>Bytes Received per Second</td><td>The total number of bytes received per second across all virtual users. Only information contained in the body of the response is counted. Header information is not counted.</td>

	<td>HTTP Errors Per Second</td><td>The number of HTTP errors received across all virtual users per second. The load test agent counts HTTP status codes between 400 and 599 as errors and any general unhandled exception while making the HTTP request to the web server, e.g. the HTTP connection was closed, as an error.</td>
