# Capturing Traffic

Click ![Camera][1] to open the Capture Traffic dialog. Before making a selection, close all browser instances as well as any other applications that may generate HTTP traffic, so that the user profile does not include extra HTTP traffic. 

![Capture Traffic][2]

This opens the **Capture Traffic** dialog. Choose whether to capture traffic from a Test Studio Web Test or capture new traffic.

![Capture Traffic Dialog][3]

If you choose **Capture from existing web test**, select the existing web test from the grid that appears. Next, select a specific browser to launch to capture the traffic. Only traffic from this browser will be captured.
Or, select a device to capture traffic from. Capturing from a remote source requires you to <a href="/features/testing-types/load-testing/configure-remote-device" target="blank">configure that device to use the remote proxy</a>.

If you selected **Capture New**: 

1.&nbsp; Record your web browser session.

2.&nbsp; Close the browser.

3.&nbsp; Click **Stop Recording**.

Next, customize the new user profile. You can return to these screens later.
