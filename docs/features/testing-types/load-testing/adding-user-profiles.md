# Load Testing: Adding User Profiles

User profiles represent what the HTTP traffic is for a particular user action or sequence. A new load test will have no user profiles. You must add at least one user profile. You may have as many user profiles contained in a load test as desired.

Click **Design** in the **Steps** ribbon and add a user profile by doing one of the following:

- <a href="/features/testing-types/load-testing/importing-traffic" target="_blank">Importing HTTP Traffic</a>
