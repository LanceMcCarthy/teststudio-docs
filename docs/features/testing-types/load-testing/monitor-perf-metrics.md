# Monitor Performance Metrics

> The target machine to be monitored must have either <a href="/general-information/test-studio-run-time" target="_blank">**Run Time edition**</a> or Test Studio installed on it. The <a href="/features/scheduling-test-runs/create-execution-server" target="_blank">execution server</a> needs to be running before Test Studio can connect to it for performance monitoring.

To monitor performance counters of one or more machines during your load test:

1.&nbsp; In the Test tab for your load test, click ![Add][1]  under Monitor Performance.

2.&nbsp; Enter the machine name or IP address for the computer you wish to monitor. This machine does not need to play a specific role in your load test, but it does need an installation of Test Studio Runtime Edition or higher.

![Computer name][2]

3.&nbsp; Click **Test Connection** to ensure Test Studio can communicate with the target machine.

![Test Connection][3]

4.&nbsp; If Test Studio can connect to the target machine, the **Available Counters** list will populate. Click each object you wish to monitor. Then, you may choose to select specific counters for each object under **Counter**.

![Available counters][4]

5.&nbsp; To save this set of performance counters for use with other load tests or machines: 

  a. Click ![disk][5]

  b. Input a name for the performance template. 

![Template][6]

6.&nbsp; Click **Save**.

![Save][7]

 An entry for this machine will appear under **Monitor Performance**. Click the checkbox next to the machine name to toggle performance monitoring for this machine.
