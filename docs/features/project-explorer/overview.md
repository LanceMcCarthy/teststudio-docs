# Project Explorer

The Project Explorer pane shows a tree-like structure of your tests in the project. Tests can be added directly to the project, or logically grouped in folders. Double click opens the test. Folders in turn, can be nested forming hierarchical representation of your testing solution. If there are multiple folders expanded you can collapse these using the Collapse button (available as of release R1 2018 - v.2018.1.130).
