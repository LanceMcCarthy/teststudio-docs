# Translators Project Settings

<a href="/getting-started/test-recording/translators" target="_blank">Translators</a> are extensions that open up an element to work with Test Studio, to allow interaction with the Elements Menu, and to expose a rich set of verification tasks. The product ships with basic translators for HTML, Silverlight, and WPF, and translators built specifically for Telerik AJAX and Silverlight RadControls, Kendo UI for jQuery, Kendo UI for Angular and Kendo UI for Blazor.

Test Studio was built with extensibility in mind, so as additional controls become available, new translators can be plugged in. Telerik is committed to maintaining translators in step with Telerik controls changes, so you can expect the translators to always be up-to-date.

The Translators section in Project settings allows you to disable or enable translators.
