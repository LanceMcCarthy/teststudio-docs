# Test Properties (Standalone)

Test Properties reflect the attributes of anything you select in the Project tab, and in some cases allows you to change these properties. For example, if you click a test node in the Project Files Pane, the Name and Path of the test will display as read-only, but other properties like Description, Owner, and Priority allow you to enter values directly.

Go the **Project Tab**, click on a test and the pane to the right will instantly show the details for this very test. Clicking All Test Properties button will show you all test properties or by pressing F4.
