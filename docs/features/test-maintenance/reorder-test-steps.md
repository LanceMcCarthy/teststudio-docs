# Reorder Test Steps

You can easily change the order of existing test steps.

1.&nbsp; Use the **Move Step Down** and **Move Step Up** icons in the Steps pane. You can Ctrl + Click multiple steps and then move them together.

![Down/UP][1]

2.&nbsp; Another option is to drag and drop the steps in the desired order. 

![Drag&drop][2]

3.&nbsp; You can select multiple steps and drag them together:

- select random steps using the keyboard **Ctrl** key and mouse clicks on the desired steps.
- select consecutive steps using the keyboard **Shift** key and mouse clicks on the desired steps.

4.&nbsp; You can use the **Cut**, **Copy** and **Paste** buttons from the *Edit* section of the *Test* ribbon. Along with these buttons you can use the standard keyboard shortcuts for each of these actions. These operations can be performed upon multiple selected steps.

![Edit][3]

5.&nbsp; You can set a **Recording Marker** to choose where to insert newly recorded steps - click the gray box to the left of the step number. An arrow will appear next to that step. An alternative for this is to use the <a href="/features/test-maintenance/test-step-context-menu" target="_blank">step context menu</a>.
