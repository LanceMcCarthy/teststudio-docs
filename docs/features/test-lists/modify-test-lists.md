# Modify Test Lists in Test Studio

While working on the test automation project, you may need to add new tests in an existing test list, or change the order of tests in a list. Test Studio allows you to modify any existing test list in the project.

The __Test Lists__ tab in the project is where you can maintain all existing test lists. Select the test list you need to modify and click the __Edit List__ button in the _Edit_ section of the tools ribbon.

The _Edit List_ dialog is very similar to the one used to create a test list. You can change the name and the type of list, add or remove tests, change the order, in which they are listed.

> __Changing the type of an existing test list may cause the included tests to be removed__, if at least one test is incompatible with the newly selected type. A message prompts to choose, if you want to continue with the modification.
