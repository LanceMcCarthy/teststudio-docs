# Manual Activation of Test Studio License

You may encounter connection errors, or attempt to activate Test Studio on a machine which is not connected to the Internet. Then, you can manually activate your purchased license.

Please note that while the machine that will run Test Studio may not be connected to the Internet, you will need access on another device to the Internet and our website to complete this process.

The steps to follow for manual license activation are as follows:

- [Activate Manually](#activate-manually)
- [Generate License Key Manually](#generate-license-key-manually)
- [Finish the Offline Activation](#finish-the-offline-activation)

## Activate Manually

Start Test Studio on the machine, where this is installed and choose the _'Activate Manually'_ button in the Test Studio License Activation Wizard.

The next screens provides the __Machine Key__ and __Machine Name__ information. Copy your machine key from the __Machine Key__ field for later use.

## Generate License Key Manually

On another machine, connected to the Internet, navigate to your Telerik account in the <a href="http://www.telerik.com/account/your-products/testing-tools-manage-license-keys.aspx" target="_blank">Test Studio License Keys Management Form</a>. Scroll to the purchased license you need to activate and click the _'Add new key'_ button.

![License Keys Management Form](/img/general-information/installation/manual-activation/fig4.png)

Enter the machine key, copied from the machine on which is Test Studio, type the machine name and friendly name for it, then click the __'Generate Key'__ button.

> __Note!__ There are reserved words that cannot be used for Machine key, Machine name and Friendly name. The words are **telerik**, **admin**, **administrator**, **sitefinity**, **icenium**, **kendo**, **kendoui** and **moderator**.

Once the key is generated you get a confirmation notification. To copy the generated key click on the _View key_ button and use the _Copy and close_ button. Paste the key onto a text document to transfer it to the machine on which is Test Studio.
