# Browser Support Updater

The __Browser support update__  is the mechanism of Test Studio to keep its compatibility with the latest browsers versions. Whenever any of the supported browsers introduces any changes in its functionalities, Test Studio needs to be updated accordingly.

When available, the __Browser support update__ notification appears next to the _Calibrate browsers_ button in the _Tests_ ribbon.
