# Guided Tutorials

Have a smooth getting started experience with the guided interactive tutorials built-in in Test Studio.

## Start a Guided Tutorial

The tutorials to help you get familiar with Test Studio can be started from the Test Studio [**Welcome Screen**](/general-information/start-a-project/welcome-screen#get-started) or from within the product.

## Scenarios to Guide You Through

Each of the interactive scenarios will guide you through the minimum required steps to start automating tests with Test Studio 

- record a test
- execute a successful test
- explore the [step failure details]() after executing a failing test

When any of the tutorials is started, the Test Studio window gets grayed out, the element on focus is left active along with a message what is the expected next action.

The message popup keeps information for the upcoming step sequence and allows you to stop the tutorial at any time. You can use the *'Escape'* button on your keyboard as well to end the tutorial.
