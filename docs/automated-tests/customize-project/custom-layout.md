# Customize Test Studio's Layout

Test Studio's layout can be customized to fit your particular needs and personal preferences. You can reorder all of the panels manually or choose from the predefined  default layouts. You can choose between _Light_ and _Dark_ themes.

The default layout, in which Test Studio starts, is the _Compact_ layout. The default theme is the _Light_ theme.

## Predefined Layouts

The available preset layouts will rearrange the panes in the Test Studio project to focus the attention on certain tools. These are the Compact (default), High Productivity and Advanced layouts.

## Switch Light/Dark Theme

Test Studio comes with two themes for the layout - _Light_ and _Dark_. You can choose which suits your needs better and <a href="/features/project-settings/theme" target="_blank">switch to it through the Project Settings</a>.

## Manual Adjustment of the Project Panels Layout

Almost all the <a href="/getting-started/first-project#test-studio-project-layout" target="_blank">panels in the Test Studio project</a> can be moved and pinned on different place in the project area.

### Dock or Undock Panel

To customize the view of the panes, you can use the _Dock/Undock_ button available in the upper right corner of the panels.

The _Undock_ will detach the pane from its original position and will display it as a separate window. This window can be dragged and dropped in the project area to be placed on another location. To help you choose the preferred position relative to the target panel, there is a circle with directions - top, bottom, left, right and center.

There are also arrows available in the right, left and bottom of the Test Studio window.

If you choose the center of the target panel, the undocked one will appear as a tab next to the target one.
