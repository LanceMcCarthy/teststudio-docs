# Customize Test Studio's Layout

You can customize Test Studio's layout to fit your needs and personal preferences. You can reorder all panels manually or choose from the predefined default layouts. You can choose between _Light_ and _Dark_ themes.

The default layout that loads when you start Test Studio is the _Compact_ layout. The default theme is the _Light_ theme.

![default layout][1]

## Predefined Layouts

The preset layouts rearrange the panes in the Test Studio project to focus your attention on certain tools. These are three available layouts:

* Compact (default)

* High Productivity

* Advanced

![preset layouts][2]

## Switch between Light and Dark Theme

Test Studio comes with a _Light_ and _Dark_ theme. Choose the one that suits your needs better and <a href="/features/project-settings/theme" target="_blank">apply it through the Project Settings</a>.

> You need to restart Test Studio to apply a new theme.

## Manual Adjustment of the Layout

You can move almost all <a href="/getting-started/first-project#test-studio-project-layout" target="_blank">panels in a Test Studio project</a> to another project area.

### Dock or Undock a Panel

To customize the view of the panes, you can use the _Dock/Undock_ button in the upper right corner of the panels.

![undock][3]

The _Undock_ detaches the pane from its original position and displays it as a separate window. You can drag and drop this window anywhere in the project area. To help you choose the preferred position relative to the target panel, there is a circle with directions - top, bottom, left, right and center.

![choose panel position][4]

There are also arrows available in the right, left and bottom of the Test Studio window.

![choose window position][4a]

If you select the center of the target panel, the undocked panel will appear as a tab next to the target panel.

<table id=no-table>
	<tr>
		<td>![choose center][5]</td>
		<td>![tabs][6]</td>
	</tr>
<table>

### Hide or Show a Panel

To hide a panel from the project's working area, select the _Pin_ button in the upper right corner of the panels. This will auto-hide the panel, and it will appear as a tab on the left or right side of the Test Studio window. Hover over this side tab, and the pane will pop up.

![auto hide][8]

### Save a Customized Layout

Use the _Save Custom Layout_ option in the Layout dropdown to save your custom changes.
