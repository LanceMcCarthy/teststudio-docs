# Quick Set BaseURL for a Project

The **Test Ribbon** in Test Studio allows you to trigger a quick test execution. Along with that it provides quick access to some useful project settings.

## Using BaseURL in Test Studio Projects

Test Studio allows you to reuse already recorded tests against multiple environments, e.g. stage, test or prod. Usually these environments only differ by their URLs, so setting a BaseURL on project level will help you execute the same tests. The **Test Ribbon** provides quick access to easily change the BaseURL and trigger a test execution against any of the available environments.

## Set BaseURL for a Project

Set a **Base Url**, if you run tests against multiple environments. Please see our <a href="/knowledge-base/test-execution-kb/base-url" target="_blank">BaseURL KB article</a> for more information.

## Adjust the Compare Mode for URLs

When a **BaseURL** is set for the project, you can change the **Compare Mode** for future recorded elements. Detailed description of the different options can be found <a href="/features/project-settings/recording-options#elements-page-compare-mode" target="_blank">here</a>.
