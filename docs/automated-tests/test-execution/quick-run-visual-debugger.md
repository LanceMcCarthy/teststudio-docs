# Enable Visual Debugger

The **Test Ribbon** in Test Studio allows you to trigger a quick test execution. Along with that it provides quick access to some useful project settings.

The __Visual Debugger__ is a useful tool to help you explore the application, while a test is being executed. It provides different options when to pause the test run and allows you to explore the current DOM tree, so far generated results, etc. The **Test Ribbon** in Test Studio provides quick access to easily maintain the debugging options for your next test run.

## Visual Debugger

The <a href="/troubleshooting-guide/troubleshooting-tools-tg/using-the-visual-debugger" target="_blank">__Visual Debugger__</a> is enabled by default and it appears in the lower right corner of your screen. It indicates the current step, includes play and pause ability, and shows additional Debug Options if you set a <a href="/features/test-maintenance/steps-pane" target="_blank">Breakpoint to any step</a>. This is a feature you could turn on or off.

## Debugger Options
