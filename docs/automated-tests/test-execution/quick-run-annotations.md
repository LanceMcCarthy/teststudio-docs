# Annotations in Quick Execution

The **Test Ribbon** in Test Studio allows you to trigger a quick test execution. Along with that it provides quick access to some useful project settings.

## Enable Annotations

The annotations highlight the target element of each executed step along with a brief message for the step action. These are helpful in any occasions when the sequence of actions cannot be followed easily and is difficult to identify which causes the unexpected application behavior. Toggle on or off the **Toggle Annotations** button.

Enabling the annotations will also slow down the test run by inserting a delay between steps (in milliseconds). The timeout can be adjusted as per the current case either from the drop-down menu or by entering a custom value.
