# Annotations in Quick Execution

The **Test Ribbon** in Test Studio allows you to trigger a quick test execution. Along with that it provides quick access to some useful project settings.

## Enable Annotations

The __annotations highlight the target element of each executed step__ along with a brief message for the step action. These are helpful in any occasions when the __sequence of actions cannot be followed__ easily and is difficult to identify, which of these causes the unexpected application behavior during the test execution. Toggle on or off the **Toggle Annotations** button.

![Toggle Annotation][7]

__Enabling the annotations will also slow down the test run__ by inserting a delay between steps (in milliseconds). The annotations timeout can be changed either from the drop-down menu or by entering a custom value.
