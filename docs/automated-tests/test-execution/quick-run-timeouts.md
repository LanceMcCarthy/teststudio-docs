# Adjust the Execution Timeouts

The **Test Ribbon** in Test Studio allows you to trigger a quick test execution. Along with that it provides quick access to some useful project settings.

The **Wait on elements** and **Client ready** timeouts are set on project level, but you can change their default values. You have quick access to change these through the **Test Ribbon**.
