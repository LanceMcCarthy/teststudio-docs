# Quick Execute Results


Let's look at an example of a [Local Data Driven Test](/features/data-driven-testing/local-data-driven-test), run with quick execute, and how to view and interpret the results.

Here is a Web Test that:

1. Navigates to http://www.google.com.
1. Sets the search query to Telerik.
1. Clicks the Search button.
1. Verifies the text block description of the first result.


The fourth step is data bound to a local data table:

![Local Test Data][1]

Click the **Run** button in the **Quick Execution** ribbon. The test steps should execute three times, once for each row in the built-in grid.


- The summary results read **Fail 11 passed out of total 12 executed**.
- There were four test steps, executed for three iterations, once for each row of data.
- Expand the drop-down menu to view the data used in each iteration.
- *Telerik* and *mobile app* both existed in the element text that step four verified.
- The data xyz did not exist in the element text so that iteration failed.

Click the blue **View Log** link to view:

- The overall result
- The result of each iteration
- The data used to drive each iteration
- Failure information
