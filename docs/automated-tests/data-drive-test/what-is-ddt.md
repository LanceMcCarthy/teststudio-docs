# What is Data Driven Testing and How Test Studio Fits for It

Data Driven Testing is a testing methodology in which the same sequence of test steps is performed repeatedly using a data source.

The input values of the test steps and/or the expected values for the verification steps are taken from the bound data source. Test Studio allows using built-in data source as well as external data files for data driven testing.

## Get Started with Data Driven Testing

To take the most of data driven testing you can start with the topics below:

* <a href="/automated-tests/data-drive-test/local-data-driven-test" target="_blank">Use built-in data table to data drive a test scenario</a>.
* <a href="/automated-tests/data-drive-test/external-data-driven-test" target="_blank">Use external data source to data drive a test scenario</a>.
* <a href="/automated-tests/data-drive-test/ddt-results" target="_blank">Analyze results from data driven test execution</a>.

## Combine Tests Executed as Steps with the Data Driven Methodology

Test Studio encourages the reuse of common tests by providing the option to <a href="/features/custom-steps/test-as-step" target="_blank">execute tests as steps</a>. Any *parent* test and any test executed as a step - *child* test, can be data driven.
