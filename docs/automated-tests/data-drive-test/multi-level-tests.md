description: "What is the execution flow in Test Studio test for nested data driven tests. I have a test step bound to a data source, which does not use it, but the parent test source instead. Data driven/bound test is nested under a test. Data driven/bound test is nested under a data driven/bound test. A test is nested under a data driven/bound test."

# Multi-level Tests


We have covered how a single level test behaves. Suppose you have more than one level using the ["Test as Step"](/features/custom-steps/test-as-step) feature? What happens? This is where Test Studio can be both complex and powerful. Here are some possible combinations and their behavior:

## Data bound Test A calls Test B

In this scenario, the data source definition for Test A will propagate down to Test B and be available for use by Test B. This is useful if you want to have one large data source supplying data to all the tests in a chain. Test A will run X times calling Test B for each iteration.

 
Example

- Test B is a Test as Step within Test A
- Data is attached to Test A.
- Test B is bound to columns from Test A's data for text entry and/or verification purposes.
 

> Test B references the data from Test A without having its own data source. The **InheritParentDataSource** [Test Property](/features/test-maintenance/test-properties-standalone) for Test B is set to True.

##Test A calls data bound Test B

In this scenario, Test A will execute only once. It will call Test B (as a Test as Step) which will execute X times as defined by the data source. This is useful if you want Test A to perform an operation once (a login for example), then execute a sequence of data driven tests.

Example

- Test A has 3 steps: login, Test as Step (Test B), and logout.
- Test B performs a data driven text input, search, and verification.


> Test B is data bound, Test A is not.

##Data bound Test A calls data bound Test B

In this scenario, Test A will execute X times according to the number of rows in its data source and call Test B X times. Test B will in turn execute Y times according to number of rows in its data source before returning to Test A. In the end, Test B will execute a total of X * Y times. This is useful if you want to perform the same data driven test in different environments (alternate login IDs, for example).

Example

- Same as second example above, except Test A is also data bound to allow for multiple logins with different usernames and passwords.

 

> Both Tests are data bound. Test A is bound with usernames and passwords, Test B is bound with search queries.
