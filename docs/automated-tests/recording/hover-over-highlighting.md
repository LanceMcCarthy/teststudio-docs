# Hover Over Highlighting

The __Highlighting menu__ is a powerful set of options related to the targeted element. It brings additional options to interact with an element in the terms of test recording, apart from clicking or entering text.

Once in an active recording session you can enable or disable the Highlighting from the **Compact Recording Toolbar**. When the mouse pauses over a highlighted element in the recording surface, you will see the __Elements menu__ with multiple options.

## Highlighting Elements Menu

This rich menu makes it easy to work with the recording surface and its elements. It provides quick access to relevant functions right in the page or application you are testing.

> Use the *Pause/Break* key on your keyboard to toggle on or off the Highlighting feature.

## __Options in the Highlighting Menu__

## Quick Steps

__Quick Steps__ submenu provides a context sensitive list of tasks, which can be performed against the highlighted element - among these are part of the <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/quick-verification" target="_blank">verification</a>, <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/wait" target="_blank">wait</a> or <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/extraction" target="_blank">extract</a> steps, related to the element's specifics.

## Add to Elements

**Add to Elements** option allows you to add the highlighted element to the selected test in project as an 'external reference' - that means the element is not related to any step from the test, but is still listed in it and can be referred from a coded step, for example.

## Locate in DOM

**Locate in DOM** is an option, which directly opens the <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/dom-explorer" target="_blank">DOM Explorer in the __Advanced Recording Tools__</a> and selects the highlighted element in the structure of the page. You can further explore the surrounding elements for the selected one, or use the options for building a step using this element.

![Locate in DOM][6]

## Build Step

**Build Step...** is an option very similar to the __Locate In DOM__ one - it selects the highlighted element in the DOM tree and directly switches to the <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/steps-overview" target="_blank">Element Steps</a> tab in the __Advanced Recording Tools__.

![Build Step][7]

There are additional actions and verifications you can add against the selected element. For example, you can add mouse actions and <a href="/features/recorder/advanced-recording-tools/element-steps/verifications/advanced-verification" target="_blank">advanced verification steps</a> for attribute, image or text from image.
