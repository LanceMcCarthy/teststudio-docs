# Create a Wait Step

You can create a Wait step in the same manner as a <a href="/features/recorder/verifications/quick-verification" target="_blank">quick verification</a> step. Instead of passing or failing based on a comparison, this step will wait for the comparison to be true before proceeding. The verification is performed after the server has responded. 

1.&nbsp; Highlight the desired element. From the menu that appears choose **Quick Steps > Wait - element exists**.

2.&nbsp; The Wait step is added to the test.

3.&nbsp; With the Wait step highlighted, you can see the test step properties where you can change the Check interval and the timeout.

4.&nbsp; You can also toggle a verify step between Verification, Wait, and Extraction (if based on text). Right click the step and select __Change Role > Set As...__
