# Activating your License #

After installing Telerik <a href="http://www.telerik.com/teststudio" target="_blank">Test Studio</a>, you will be asked to activate your license. During this process, your machine creates its own unique key and provides it to our server. We use this key to generate a unique license key for the installation of the product. This article discusses how to go through this process and provides a guided walk-through. All users, both trial and purchased, will need to activate their product after installation before they can begin using the tool.
 
The below process assumes that you have not launched the Standalone or VS plugin version after the installation completed. If you have already launched Test Studio and are ready to input your licensing data (user email and password), skip to step 3.

1. Launch Test Studio:
	* __Standalone version__: Click Start > Programs > Telerik > Test Studio > Launch Test Studio
	* __Visual Studio plugin__: Click Start > Programs > Microsoft Visual Studio 20XX > Microsoft Visual Studio 20XX
	

2. This step is for VS plugin users only. Standalone users can skip to step 3. If you have a project with a Test Studio test in it, open the project within Visual Studio, and then the test. If you do not have a solution or project of this type, perform steps 1-3 listed here to begin activation.
	
3. Input the email address and password that correspond to your <a href="https://www.telerik.com/login/v2/telerik?returnurl=%2f" target="_blank">Telerik.com</a> account.
