# Re-activating your License #

There are some occasions when a machine with an activated license cannot be accessed to deactivate the license. Then, you can manually delete the old key and re-generate a new one.

## Problem ##

My machine was freshly imaged or replaced and I need to re-activate my license on the new machine. When I try to re-activate my new machine I have 0 seats available.

## Solution ##

1. Log on to your <a href="http://www.telerik.com" target="_blank">Telerik.com</a> account.

2. Navigate to __Test Studio__ product.

3. <a href="http://www.telerik.com/account/your-products/testing-tools-manage-license-keys.aspx" target="_blank">Manage Test Studio Activation Keys</a>.

4. Find and delete your old key. This will free up a slot allowing to activate your new machine.
