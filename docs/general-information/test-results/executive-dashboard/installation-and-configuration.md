# Installation and Configuration

1. <a href="/general-information/installation/install-procedure" target="_blank">Install the Executive Dashboard components</a> in the **Customize Installation dialog** during Test Studio installation for the machine that will host this service. It is not selected by default in the standalone installation and you can <a href="/general-information/installation/add-services" target="_blank">add it after that</a>.

    ![Installation Dialog][1]

2. Start Test Studio and click **Configure** in the Scheduling section of the ribbon bar.

    ![Configure][2]

3. In the **Executive Dashboard** tab you can see the current configurations and change them, if necessary. You need to hit the **Apply** button, before the new configurations are set. That will restart the **Executive Dashboard** and show you details about the storage service's status and database version in the **Executive Dashboard Storage Service Location** section. You will also see a message in the lower left corner of the wizard stating *'Telerik Test Studio Executive Dashboard is started'*.
