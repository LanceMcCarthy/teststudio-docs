# Test Results Calendar #

Execute your tests via a <a href="/getting-started/test-execution/test-lists-standalone" target="_blank">Test List</a> to populate the Results tab. This tab tracks the outcome of your test lists and shows pass, fail, or scheduled results in a handy graphic calendar or timeline display.

* View the test lists that passed or failed in a month, week, or day.

* Buttons along the top let you jump between Day, Week, Month, and Timeline views.

* Navigation buttons in the upper right allow you to move back and forward through a period of time, based on that view.

* Click ![Calendar button][1] to display a pop-up calendar to jump to a particular day.

* Test list results are shown as colored blocks, indicated by the key at the bottom of the view.

* Results cannot be moved, but can be deleted by clicking the X button that appears during mouseover.
