# In-Product Tips And Tricks

While automating the desired test scenarios you will receive tips and tricks to provide you useful information for features in Test Studio.

## Tips And Tricks Window

The Tips And Tricks Popup displays a list of hints relevant to your actions in the product. Each newly appeared tip is bolded and marked with a label *New*. Once an item in the list is clicked the *New* label disappears and at the bottom of the window an overview for the selected hint is displayed.

The tips and tricks are divided in few sections - Tests, Steps, Elements, Project, Test Lists and Results and are being triggered depending on your actions in Test Studio. Each item has a link to our online documentation where you can find additional details. Most of them also provide a link to a video demonstrating the feature.

## Toggle Tips And Tricks

The number of unexplored items you have received is displayed in the **Tips And Tricks toggle button** in a red circle in the upper right corner of Test Studio window. Toggle it to show/hide the Tips And Tricks window.

If you close the tips window you can bring it up again by clicking that toggle button and review all tips triggered so far (including these you have already explored).

>**Note**: The tips and tricks are user based. That means that if another user launches Test Studio he will have the Getting started experience as well.

By default the **Always show this pop-up** option is checked and the *Tips And Tricks* window will instantly popup. If you would like to stop the *Tips and Tricks* window from popping up uncheck that checkbox.
