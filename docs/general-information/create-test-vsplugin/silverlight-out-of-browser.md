# Create a Silverlight Out-of-Browser Test (VS plugin) #

__Important Notes:__


* If you are testing a Silverlight In-Browser web application, we recommend treating it as a standard <a href="web-test" target="_blank">Web Test</a> with no additional configuration.

* See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd550721(v=vs.95).aspx" target="_blank">here</a> for what constitutes Out-of-Browser.

* Once a Silverlight Out-of-Browser application is configured for recording, Test Studio modifies its shortcut to point directly to the application's location on disk. This replaces the Microsoft "offline://" notation. The side effect of this is that your application will not detect that it is running in Out-of-Browser mode and code must be written in the application to work around this limitation.

* Test Studio does not support the Web Browser control in Silverlight Out-of-Browser applications.

1. Launch Test Studio.
2. Click __Telerik > Test Studio > Create New Test Project__.

	![Create test project][1]

3. Choose __Telerik > Test > VB or C# Test Studio Project__, name the project, and click __OK__.<br> 

	**Note:** As of version 2015.3.1202 Test Studio projects will appear only under **.NET Framework 4.5** or higher.

	![Create C#/VB project][2]


4. A Web Test is added to the project. Open it and click the __Configure Silverlight App__ icon in the toolbar.

	![Configure SL App][3]

5. Check the __Configure this test to run against a Silverlight application__ box in Out-Of-Browser options.
6. Browse for the Local Application Directory or drag and drop a link to your Silverlight application.
7. Select __Silverlight Out-of-Browser__ under __Recording Host__.

8. Click __Record__ to launch the out-of-browser app with the recording toolbar docked at the top.

Notice that steps are added to the test as actions are taken within the application.
