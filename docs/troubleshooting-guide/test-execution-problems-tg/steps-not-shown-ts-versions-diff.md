# Test Steps Not showing in Step Panel


## Problem

Steps are not shown in the step panel when selecting a test from the project explorer. An empty screen appears instead of the recorded steps.

*Reason: The project is opened with older version than the one used for the recording.* 

## Solution

Update the Test Studio that is used to open the project. It must be either the version that was used to create the project or a later one.
All supported versions will be available under downloads in your Telerik account.
