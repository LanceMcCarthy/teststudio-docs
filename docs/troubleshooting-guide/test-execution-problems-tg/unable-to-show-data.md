# Unable to Show Data Tables in Excel Data Source

## PROBLEM 1

If running a data driven test on remote machine you get your test failed and the following exception could be found in the log:

***The 'Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0' provider is not registered on the local machine***

> This could happen on machines with no Microsoft Office or Data Connectivity Component installed.

## PROBLEM 2

I am able to bind an excel file to be used for data driving a test but there are no sheets listed to select from:

![No sheets][1]

> This could be observed also if the Microsoft Office package is 64-bit version.

## SOLUTION

Download and install the 32-bit version of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255" target="_blank">Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010</a>. It will install the required drivers for communication between Test Studio and the Microsoft Office files for all of the above cases.
