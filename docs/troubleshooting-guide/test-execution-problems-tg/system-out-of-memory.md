# System.OutOfMemoryException

## PROBLEM

My data driven test has hundreds or thousands of iterations. It fails during execution with one the following errors:

- *EXCEPTION! (see below)<br>
  Outer Exception Type: System.OutOfMemoryException<br>
  Message: Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.*

- *Error attempting to execute a Test As Step. Details:<br>
  System.OutOfMemoryException: Out of memory.*


## SOLUTION

A test with that many iterations is very likely to encounter memory issues deep into execution. To combat this, use the **ReuseAppWindow** feature available in the <a href="/features/test-maintenance/test-properties-standalone" target="_blank">Test Properties</a>. This defines the number of iterations to reuse the browser window for a single test.

![ReuseApp][1]

By default, zero keeps the same application open during the entire data driven test. Increasing that number can help to improve memory and performance. For example, a value of 50 causes the browser/app to close and reopen after every 50 iterations.

## PROBLEM

When executing a test in Internet Explorer 9 on a Windows 7 32-bit or Windows XP machine, ArtOfTest.Runner exits unexpectedly, displaying this error:

- *EXCEPTION! (see below)<br>
  Outer Exception Type: System.OutOfMemoryException<br>
  Message: Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.*

However, there is sufficient available system memory. 

## SOLUTION

This error is caused by the Microsoft UI Automation framework, which Test Studio uses to monitor dialogs. To avoid it, enable the **DisableDialogMonitoring** <a href="/features/test-maintenance/test-properties-standalone" target="_blank">Test Property</a> or <a href="/getting-started/test-execution/test-list-settings" target="_blank">Test List Setting</a>. Note: this will prevent your test from handling dialogs.
