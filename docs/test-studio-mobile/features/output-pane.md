# Output Pane in Test Studio Mobile

The **Output** window displays a record of log messages recorded by Test Studio Mobile throughout runtime. These include build errors that occur when a project is compiled.

You can find it in the Output tab on the middle bottom pane by default. If it is hidden you can display it from **View -> Output**.

You can chose between **General** and **Compiler** option to filter the type of information in the pane.
