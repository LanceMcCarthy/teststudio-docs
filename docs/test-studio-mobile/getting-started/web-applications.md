# Getting Started with Web Applications in Test Studio Mobile

This section walks you through the process of recording your first Test Studio Mobile web test and execute it in a browser (Mobile or Desktop). Before you start, please ensure the following:

* You have access to a Windows machine where Test Studio Ultimate will be installed. The Test Studio Mobile solution currently works only on Windows machines and installs as part of the Test Studio product.

## Connect Agent(Browser)

Connecting a web browser to Test Studio Mobile is a multi-step process that uses a built-in WebProxy. The proxy is responsible for injecting a Web Extension in every page that a web test navigates to.

* [Web Connection]({% slug ms-configure-tsm%})

##Record and Playback Test

Once the above setup is complete you can start

* [Recording your test]({% slug ms-record-test-web%})

or

* [Playback your test]({% slug ms-quick-execution%})
